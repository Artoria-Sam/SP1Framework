Author:SIM TZE JAN commit:Updated the framework to show how event input handlers work Added a keyboard input handler Added a mouse input handler Sample code on how to interpret input events.
Author:SIM TZE JAN commit:Implemented Event based input for keyboard and mouse If a keyboard or mouse event has triggered in the console, it will call the respective keyboard or mouse handler set by the user.
Author:Sim Tze Jan commit:Added in a parameter in writeToBuffer to indicate the length of the string to write. Without this parameter, the function will write until the null character.
Author:SIM TZE JAN commit:Optimise the writeToBuffer function so that it does not need to check the length of the string. clearBuffer now access the memory location once, instead of twice. writeToConsole does not need to create temporary variables anymore.
